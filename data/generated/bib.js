Almost unlimited access to educational information plethora came with a drawback: finding meaningful material is not a straightforward task anymore. Based on a survey related to how students find additional bibliographical resources for university courses, we concluded there is a strong need for recommended learning materials, for specialized online search and for personalized learning tools. As a result, we developed an educational collaborative filtering recommender agent, with an integrated learning style finder. The agent produces two types of recommendations: suggestions and shortcuts for learning materials and learning tools, helping the learner to better navigate through educational resources. Shortcuts are created taking into account only the user\u2019s profile, while suggestions are created using the choices made by the learners with similar learning styles. The learning style finder assigns to each user a profile model, taking into account an index of learning styles, as well as patterns discovered in the virtual behavior of the user. The current study presents the agent itself, as well as its integration to a virtual collaborative learning environment and its success and limitations, based on users\u2019 feedback.",

        "abstract": "When people want to move to a new job, it is often difficult since there is too much job information available. To select an appropriate job and then submit a resume is tedious. It is particularly difficult for university students since they normally do not have any work experience and also are unfamiliar with the job market. To deal with the informa- tion overload for students during their transition into work, a job recommendation system can be very valuable. In this research, after fully investigating the pros and cons of current job recommendation systems for university students, we propose a student profiling based re-ranking framework. In this system, the students are recommended a list of potential jobs based on those who have graduated and obtained job offers over the past few years. Furthermore, recommended employers are also used as input for job recommendation result re-ranking. Our experimental study on real recruitment data over the past four years has shown this method\uff07s potential.",

        "abstract": "Artificial intelligence applications have revolutionized business, industry, and education. Applications developed for other sectors are being adapted for education. The amount of data being generated by educational institutions is used to make recommendations for a wide range of areas. The study uses bibliometric analysis to evaluate the development and growth of recommender systems in higher education. Two hundred seventy-two (272) articles published between 2007 and 2021 in the Scopus database were utilized to collect data. The study examines the different patterns such as publication trends, the relative growth rate (RGR) and doubling time (DT) for publications. Results show a steady increase in publications, with 2017 recording the highest number of publications. China, Spain and the United States have the highest publications. The mean RGR decreased, and the mean doubling time increased in the three-five-year periods. The study identified sixteen themes covered by the research articles analyzed. Most articles focused on e-learning, followed by classroom activities and, thirdly, those focusing on course selection. The study provides essential insights into current and future research on recommender systems in higher education. This analysis helps researchers, policymakers, and practitioners better understand the development of recommender systems in higher education and possible practice implications.",

In this paper, we present an overview of the methods that are applied to personalize learning paths as well as their advantages and disadvantages.

        "abstract": "Skills-based hiring is a talent management approach that empowers employers to align recruitment around business results, rather than around credentials and title. It starts with employers identifying the particular skills required for a role, and then screening and evaluating candidates\u2019 competencies against those requirements. With the recent rise in employers adopting skills-based hiring practices, it has become integral for students to take courses that improve their marketability and support their long-term career success. A 2017 survey of over 32,000 students at 43 randomly selected institutions found that only 34{%} of students believe they will graduate with the skills and knowledge required to be successful in the job market. Furthermore, the study found that while 96{%} of chief academic officers believe that their institutions are very or somewhat effective at preparing students for the workforce, only 11{%} of business leaders strongly agree [11]. An implication of the misalignment is that college graduates lack the skills that companies need and value. Fortunately, the rise of skills-based hiring provides an opportunity for universities and students to establish and follow clearer classroom-to-career pathways. To this end, this paper presents a course recommender system that aims to improve students\u2019 career readiness by suggesting relevant skills and courses based on their unique career interests.",

        "abstract": "Attaining those skills that match labor market demand is getting increasingly complicated, not in the last place in engineering education, as prerequisite knowledge, skills, and abilities are evolving dynamically through an uncontrollable and seemingly unpredictable process. Anticipating and addressing such dynamism is a fundamental challenge to twenty-first century education. The burgeoning availability of data, not only on the demand side but also on the supply side (in the form of open educational resources) coupled with smart technologies, may provide a fertile ground for addressing this challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel, Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven approach to the development of an open, personalized, and labor market oriented learning recommender system, called eDoer. We discuss the complete system development cycle starting with a systematic user requirements gathering, and followed by system design, implementation, and validation. Our recommender prototype (1) derives the skill requirements for particular occupations through an analysis of online job vacancy announcements; (2) decomposes skills into learning topics; (3) collects a variety of open online educational resources that address those topics; (4) checks the quality of those resources and topic relevance with three intelligent prediction models; (5) helps learners to set their learning goals towards their desired job-related skills; (6) recommends personalized learning pathways and learning content based on individual learning goals; and (7) provides assessment services for learners to monitor their progress towards their desired learning objectives. Accordingly, we created a learning dashboard focusing on three Data Science related jobs and conducted an initial validation of eDoer through a randomized experiment. Controlling for the effects of prior knowledge as assessed by means of a pretest, the randomized experiment provided tentative support for the hypothesis that learners who engaged with personal recommendations provided by eDoer to acquire knowledge of basic statistics, attained higher scores on the posttest than those who did not. The hypothesis that learners who received personalized content in terms of format, length, level of detail, and content type, would achieve higher scores than those receiving non-personalized content was not supported.",
